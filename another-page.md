## About the club

Richmond Rockets was formed in 2019.  We currently have six teams ranging between Under 7 and Under 12 playing football in the Hambleton and Richmondshire Junior Football League.

Our ethos is all about fun, enjoyment and inclusivity.  We are committed to provide equal playing time in matches, regardless of ability.  Everyone is welcome!
